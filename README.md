## Ideas to talk about in the presentation


<br/>

▪ What was your requirements gathering and design process? Was it useful/successful?
   ```md
   I started by creating a simple list of features and requirements I wanted for my e-commerce store, I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted to build so I didn't use figma and went straight into it. I also had a to do list that I'd write things to fix or add soon as I had the thought
   ```

</br>

▪ Give a high level overview of your application and its features.
 ```md
   This is a front-end only e-commerce shop built using next.js and react, I've got a lot of features such as filtering products by search, category and price, adding products to cart, saving cart state across pages, product detailed page, home page, about page, checkout page, pagination, responsive design and styling.
 ```


</br>

▪ How can the user interact with this app?
 ```md
They can add/remove products to cart, filter products, view single products in more detail, enter payment / shipping information on the checkout page etc.
 ```

</br>

▪ Which specific methods from the React library have you utilized in your projects, and what are your experiences or insights regarding their usage and effectiveness?
 ```md
useState, useEffect, useRef, useContext - They all were effective, useContext I struggled with but once I got worked was able to share the cart state across all pages
```

</br>

▪ If you used Next.JS, could you please share your thoughts on the routing capabilities it offers? How does the routing functionality in Next.js compare to other frameworks or libraries you have worked with in terms of ease of use, flexibility, and any notable features?
 ```md
   It made the routing seem so simple compared to node.js and express, I really like the routing capability of next.js
```

</br>

▪ What external tools/libraries have you used? How? Why?
*(eg. bootstrap/material ui/tailwind)*
 ```md
React-Bootstrap
Bootswatch for themes
FortAwesome icon library 
 ```

</br>

▪ How might you extend the features of your application in future?
 ```md
 I was thinking I could add an actual payment integration using visa or paypal, this requires a backend. User login to add reviews to products and add items to wishlist
 Also I was thinking of adding a chatbot using the ChatGPT API but this also required a back end
 ```

 </br>

<div>
<sup>optional*</sup>
</div>

▪ Where does its data come from (external/internal APIs)?


 ```md
   FakeStore API
 ```


▪ *If you used Typescript, how does TypeScript compare to JavaScript in terms of their features, benefits, and differences?


 ```md
Specifying the types makes it a lot easier to catch errors before you run the code, it seems like a more detailed and complete version of javascript to me 
 ```
